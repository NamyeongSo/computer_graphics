## Introduction

This course has been a journey through the depths of computer graphics, exploring the theoretical foundations and practical applications. From understanding the basics of pixel manipulation to implementing advanced shading models, each assignment has pushed the boundaries of what I thought was possible with computer graphics.

## Technologies Used

- OpenGL
- WebGL
- GLSL
- C++
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
